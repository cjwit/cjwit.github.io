# Music and Healing in Morocco travel information (January 2020)

This page is an overview of useful material as we plan our trip to Morocco. Since we will be based in Fez for the first two weeks and this is where we will have the most independence, the bulk of the information is about that city. Pretty much everything applies for our travels during the third week, as well.

## Contact information

In case of emergency, you will contact InternationalSOS using the numbers on the card that you were given when you registered your travel and/or went to the Education Abroad orientation meeting. **That number is 1-215-942-8478. You call collect.**

The phone number for Education Abroad at BGSU is 419-372-2247.

If you have any questions or need any help, you can contact me (using a Moroccan number or an American one, both of which I will provide as we get closer to travel) or reach out to our partners in Morocco directly. Here are some ways to get in touch while we are abroad: 

* We will create a WhatsApp group that includes your American and Moroccan phones.
* My Moroccan phone number should be 06 24 97 28 34 if you are calling from within Morocco or (212) 624 97 28 34‬‬ if you are calling from the USA. It's possible that this number has expired since I last used the SIM card. If so, I will update everyone with a new number. 
* My email is [cwituls@bgsu.edu](mailto:cwituls@bgsu.edu). 
* My Skype account is *cwitulski* and FaceTime is *chris.witulski@gmail.com*.
* Depending on the SIM card situation, I also intend to provide a forwarding phone number from the USA.

Our program is in partnership with the American Language Center (ALC) in Fez, which also holds the Arabic Language Institute in Fez (ALIF). The school teaches English to Moroccan students and Arabic to international students, which is where the potentially confusing pair of names comes in.

[ALIF's website](http://www.alif-fes.com) has addresses and contact info, but I'll include it here, too:

* Their phone is (212) 535 62 48 50 from outside Morocco or 05 35 62 48 50 from within. (You replace the 212 country code with a 0 in Moroccan numbers.) 
* Their address is 2 Rue Ahmed Hiba, Fes, Ville Nouvelle 30000 Morocco. 

I'll provide accomodations information for our travel to Marrakech and the desert when it's finalized. Write these numbers down and keep them on you in case you need to show a taxi or your phone battery dies!

## International travel, passport, visa, and money

While we do not need a visa ahead of time for travel to Morocco, you will need to be sure that your passport is valid for more than six months following the date of arrival. This means that your expiration date should be in the second half of 2020 or later (after July). Our visa will be a 90 day tourist visa that gets stamped at passport control when we arrive in Casablanca.

### Flight and airport transportation

Our group flight will be from Detroit (DTW) to Casablanca (CMN) and back. We will not have transportation to and from Detroit because people will be coming from home and not campus. You are welcome to arrange transportation to the Detroit airport with friends to save on parking or get dropped off. Check Air Canada for specifics on luggage requirements. Once we arrive, we will have transportation arranged for the drive from Casablanca to Fez, which is likely to be a 4-5 hour drive.

### It's a cash economy

There are a growing number of exceptions, but Morocco is almost universally a cash economy. Bring your debit and credit card so that you can use an ATM when necessary and you may want to check with your bank about what the international fees are. You will also need to call your bank to tell them that you are traveling so that they don't flag any transactions as fraud. Although, in my experience, they will do that at least once anyhow. You can also change cash, though places to do that can be harder to find after we leave the airport.

My suggestion here is to use an ATM to get a large withdrawal (you can usually get $400 or $500 at a time before your bank flags the transactions). Use ATMs in public places at major banks, preferably in the "new city" right before you get into a taxi, go into a restaurant, or otherwise do something that makes it unlikely for you to be followed. There are some notes on safety below, but just imagine that you are in a bad part of town: there is a great deal of poverty in cities in Morocco, just like in places like certain parts of Detroit, Chicago, and Toledo.

The exchange rate right now is right around 10:1, so a dinner that costs 50 Moroccan dirhams (MAD) will be roughly $5. It makes for easy math.

### Tipping

Tipping works differently in Morocco than here, but it fairly similar to practices in Europe. Good service should yield a few dirhams for a cafe or restaurant, more at a place that is expensive (meaning, largely for rich Moroccans and foreigners). Most costs should be worked out ahead of time for things like taxis and porters (people who carry your bags), but you may still want to tip them. Remember, this is an impoverished area and what is a little bit for you can make a big difference for others.

### Negotiating

Almost everything is negotiable and prices are largely unmarked. Where they are marked, they are usually pretty much fixed, but that's rare. The markup can be as high as ten times the cost that you should pay. Feel free to ask me about the appropriate price for things, though prices change and I may not always be perfectly accurate. Knowing some Arabic (even the tiniest bit that we will learn in our few lessons) can go a long way, as can shopping off of the beaten path. The further you are from tourists, the more likely you'll be treated like a regular person. But then it's difficult to communicate without Arabic. My best suggestion is to keep a pen and notepad to write down numbers. A price that sounds fair to you and that the seller is happy with is a fair price, even if someone else could get a better one.

And don't get me started on the Moroccan system of dealing with currency! (Short version: there's an old coin called a rial that hasn't been around for decades. But people still use it and it's 1/20 of a dirham, so you can get prices that require you to figure out multiples of 5 and 20 in your head. This is pretty much only for poor areas and food markets when speaking Arabic, so you are unlikely to have to deal with it.)

## Luggage and packing

Check Air Canada's website for details on what you are allowed to bring ([carry on limits](https://www.aircanada.com/us/en/aco/home/plan/baggage/carry-on.html), [checked baggage](https://www.aircanada.com/us/en/aco/home/plan/baggage/checked.html)). As of now (October 2019), the limit is one carry on and one personal item as is usual, plus a single checked bag weighing under 50 pounds.

I highly recommend that you actually weigh all of your bags (just stand on a scale with and without the bag in hand to see the weight) because I've been that person who has to open up a suitcase, move things around, and throw things out because I packed over the limit!

### Other suggestions about luggage

* We will be walking a lot and sidewalks in Morocco are rarely friendly nor are they ever flat. My best suggestion is to pack light enough to carry everything, but if you can't do that, sure to have *very* sturdy rolling bags. Heavy duty backpacks are ideal for this kind of travel. Fez is built into a valley between mountains, so every road goes up and down at odd angles and there will be days when it feels more like urban hiking than walking.
* Consider packing lightly or bringing clothes that you don't care about so you can toss or give them away and make space for anything you want to buy and bring back. It's a good chance to clean out the closet. No one will judge you on your wardrobe, so just be functional!

### Layers of clothing

When packing clothing, remember that *it will not be warm*. It will be pretty cold on some days and rainy at times. When we're in the mountains, altitude cools things off. When we are in the desert, the lack of humidity does the same thing. But, it will also be sunny and you'll be walking a lot. It's not that any given point is freezing, it's just that the 40s and 50s start to feel really cold when you don't have central heating to come home to. You should have heat, but spaces can be large and hard to heat and some have courtyards with open ceilings. If we are listening to music in a room that feels like it's outside for a few hours at night, you'll want to be warm.

Pack layers. Lots of layers. In fact, you should plan on wearing three or so shirts at any given time. You can wear the outer layers pretty much every day: you only need two or three sets. The inner t-shirt is the only thing you really have to change and you'll have access to laundry, so you don't need to do that much either. One week's worth should be more than enough.

For the outer layers, consider heavy natural fibers like wool that breathe well. Pants can be jeans, but I also recommend a good pair of long underwear, again something from a camping store or similar that will breathe well so you can wear it over and over again. You'll be able to recognize people as much by their clothes as anything because we will not be the only ones wearing the same outer layers every day.

And again, for some of these layers, think about bringing clothing that you don't mind just leaving in Morocco if you need space for packing on the way back.

### Other clothes to pack

Aside from layers and long underwear, be sure to pack a hat and gloves. The fingerless kind are actually really useful because there may be days when you want gloves on all day long. You may end up wearing a beanie all day long or never. These things pack easily and are worth having in case you need them.

It's imperative to have very comfortable shoes. Again, consider this less like taking a walk and more like an urban hike. Good sneakers or heavy duty shoes are worth it. It's not likely to be sandal weather and if it were, you'd want something like a pair of Tevas.

### Other packing thoughts

Regarding issues of modesty: Morocco is not as conservative in dress as people generally think when they imagine the Middle East and North Africa. That said, it'll be cold and dressing in any revealing way at all will bring on uninvited attention, causing harassment issues to be worse than they already will be. So let Moroccan's push the boundaries and wear long pants and sleeves (for warmth) and avoid any low necklines or similar things.

There is a new mall in Fez that has everything from a supermarket to a Cartier store. This means that you do not need to pack everything: you can buy toiletries, clothes, etc., if you forget them or need more. So don't stress too much about it.

### Packing list

For the airplane/carry on:

* Passport
* Printed itinerary and contact information on the American Language Center in Fez (see the top of this page) and my phone number
* Phone, computer, and chargers for each
* Travel adapter for phone/electronics (Morocco uses the standard for Europe, see below)
* Voltage converter if you need one (see below)
* Backup battery charger if you want one
* Headphones and earplugs
* A book
* A pen for any customs paperwork
* Spare glasses (long flights can be far more comfortable with glasses than contacts)
* Small toiletries
* Extra underwear in case of a lost suitcase
* Dry snack
* Water bottle to fill up after security
* A pack of tissues
* Cash to change in case a debit card does not work right away
* Dramamine for flight and van/bus if you need it

Clothes and other things

* Layers, including sweater, long underwear
* Good comfortable shoes
* Hat and gloves
* A driver's license or other form of ID so that you can leave your passport safely locked up
* Hard copy of our course readings so you are not dependent on internet access
* Small gift for homestay family, if you would like

## Cell phones

Morocco has very good cell service and decent 3G internet. The internet is not what we are used to and often does not work, but it's enough to be worthwhile. Being able to send texts and photos back home from a phone is really convenient and something that I could not do even ten years ago. Google Maps is also starting to be more useful, which can help in a crunch.

Check with your carrier to see if your phone is unlocked. Most iPhones after a certain generation are unlocked by default. If you have a SIM card slot on your phone and it's unlocked, you can easily put in a Moroccan SIM card and use WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger to chat or call internationally for no fee. The phone and internet prepaid cards do cost money, but it's not too much. We can go to a tele-boutique as a group when we arrive to get that set up. If your phone is locked or does not have a SIM card (my old Verizon phones always fell into this category), then you can buy a cheap one there for under $100 and either sell it or give it away as a gift when you leave.

### Travel chargers: converters and adapters

Morocco's voltage is like Europe's: it is 220 instead of 110. This means that you need a converter for some things, but most modern phones can accept the 220 voltage without any trouble. A quick internet search will tell you if yours does. If you are bringing any electronics, take a look at the (very) fine print near the plug to see if you need to convert voltage. If so, get a converter.

A voltage converter is not the same thing as a travel plug! Besides the differnet voltage, the shape of the power outlets in Morocco is different than here. It matches what you see in most of Europe with two rounded prongs instead of our two flat ones. Even if you do not need a voltage converter, you will need a travel adapter to make your power plug fit into the wall sockets.

I've never traveled with a battery backup before, but they are getting cheaper and I may try it this time around. For long days of flying and/or travel, or any evenings where you forget to charge your phone, it may be worth it. That one is up to you!

## Homestays

Some people may have the option of staying in the Arabic Language Center residence in the new city (the *ville nouvelle*). Everyone else will be assigned to homestays with families in Fez. We will all be together when we are in the desert and in hotels in Marrakech.

Since we are pretty short term in Fez (we'll only be there for two weeks), I am not sure how they will go about assigning homestay families. You may have some choices. These could be things like: would you prefer to have an English speaker in the family or not? Would you prefer to be in the old walled city (a very different experience) or have the amenities of the new city? Our classes will be near the edge of the old city, so either will work. Taxis from the new city can be irritating to get, but walking from the depths of the old city can be a hike. I'll add more information about what options we have when we find out more. I will email the homestay forms as we get closer.

Aside from food (below), homestays should also provide a locked space for your valuables and for things like washing your clothes. I'd avoid drinking the water (see below), but showers and whatnot are fine. New city homes should have regular showers, old city homes may not. In some cases (though increasingly rare), old city homes may have squat toilets, too. But, on the flip side, you might end up with beautiful terrace views of a city unlike any you've ever seen and a very different experience of neighborhood than you can get elsewhere. It's all a trade off.

It's inappropriate to bring any alcohol into any homestay family's home, so don't do it. And while there are bars, safety issues are obviously compounded when alcohol is involved, just like they are in a college town.

### Food

Homestay assignments will be in groups of two or three, so you will not be alone. Meals are included, which means that you will be having home cooked Moroccan food for your time in Fez. That doesn't mean that you can't eat out, and I'll give you some good restaurant suggestions as we go. Three of my favorites in Fez that run a pretty dramatic range, if you want to look them up and get hungry, are Thami's restaurant (a friendly guy who makes good food at on a busy corner where you can people watch... this is where you'll find me most of the time), Clock Cafe (a trendy place owned by a Brit), Fez Cafe (a nice restaurant tucked into a peaceful large garden owned by a French family). So many people have moved into Fez that you can find Thai food, Japanese restaurants, pizza places, and everything in between, even in the old walled city (the *madina*). The new city has everything you would expect, including the most beautiful McDonald's you've seen and the new mall's Pizza Hut.

If you have dietary restrictions, we should talk. Some are easy to work with, others can be much harder to get around, but all are possible. We'll also communicate these to the school so that we can ensure that the families know about them or, if you prefer, we can try and get anyone with dietary issues into the residence, where you can cook for yourself. Once we are closer, our partners will be able to let us know more about this option.

## Out and about

### Food on the go

When you're out and about, you can always get some food on the go. Street food is great and, generally, pretty safe. You can usually tell which places are a good idea to eat at and which ones you should avoid.

Small shops called "hanouts" are all over and they sell a wide range of useful things. Some that are handy for a quick snack are yogurt (called "Danon" after the French company) if you are comfortable eating by squeezing the container, drinkable yogurt, sardines ("samak") that are pretty good on a piece of round bread ("khubs"), and nuts.

### In town taxis (Petite Taxi)

Morocco's taxi system has two types of rides. The red petite taxi takes you around in town. You share the ride, which means that the taxi may pick up other passengers while you're on your way and, if you know which way you are heading, you can try and wave them down as you walk even if there are other people in them.

They use a meter, called a counter, but you need to be sure that it's on before you get too far. If not, someone might try and rip you off on the price. The trip from the mall in the new city to the main entrances to the old city is about 10 dirhams, give or take a little depending on traffic.

### Getting around in Fez

Fez is made up of two large areas. The new city is the French-built *ville nouvelle*. This is where the mall and the language school's main offices are. It's also where the residence is for anyone who ends up there. The old city is called the *madina* and is a 1200-year-old walled city. It's the world's largest urban car-free zone, which means that getting around involves lots of walking through crowded and confusing ancient alleyways. Our classes will meet in the language school's *riad*, a beautiful tiled indoor garden on the edge of the *madina*.

## Safety

In general, treat urban Morocco like you treat any urban area. You will be surrounded by poverty and all of the challenges that come with it, just like you would be in bad parts of Toledo, Detroit, or Chicago. Be careful, aware, and conscious of how your choices matter.

In many ways, the hardest thing is the constant attention that you will get as a tourist. People selling things will get in your way while others (especially young men) will constantly call out as you pass by. For women, especially, it's a barrage of consistent harassment to the point of being touched multiple times on every walk. You will have to consider how your response to this will impact any interactions, but often the simplest and safest is to ignore it. That's not easy to do, though, and it will take an emotional toll on you. Find comfortable spaces and frequent them when you need to and find people to talk to. Keep open with me and classmates. They are going through the same thing. (As a note: if you are comfortable with it, buying a cheap ring to wear as a wedding ring can help, but it doesn't eliminate the problem.)

Here are some things to keep in mind:

* Travel in groups. Everywhere. All the time. Safety aside, it's really easy to get lost and far better to be lost together than by yourself!
* Walk with purpose and look like you know where you're going, even if you don't. It won't stop all badgering from people around you, but it will help.
* Be aware of who is near you and your surroundings.
* Try and study a map of where you are going, but don't be surprised if you get lost. If you do, ask for directions at a shop. If you end up asking a child, give a tip. Don't ask men on the street if you can help it.
* Carry a bit of money, but not all of it. Don't carry your passport, but have a driver's license or some other type of ID in case something happens.
* Don't be out after dark, especially in the old city. We will have some late nights as a class and we'll work out getting everyone back on those days. But after shops close in the old city, streets fill up with boys and men who are smoking and drinking and, often, causing trouble.
* If someone robs you, give them whatever they ask for. Keep your phone backed up and use a password so that no one can get into your business. Insurance can cover some of those costs and that is likely to simply end an altercation. Do not fight back. I knew someone who pulled a knife on some Moroccan boys instead of giving them his wallet, which was a terrible idea and he ended up leaving the country a day or two later.
* Morocco is full of gendered spaces. If you are a woman and see a cafe full of men, you can go sit there (because you will be seen as a tourist), but don't be surprised to get stares. At the same time, places geared toward foreigners are perfectly welcoming (like Cafe Clock). Young Moroccan couples often go to these places to hang out with their significant others for the same reason.
* Speaking of: places like Cafe Clock are great for doing work on a laptop. Cafes or places that open up to the street are not. I've heard of people on mopeds driving right up to outdoor tables, swiping a computer, and driving away. For reasons like this, it's much more comfortable to work with a book and notebook. I rarely carry my computer around unless I really need a new place to do some writing.
* Same thing with nice cameras: I usually take a day or two and get all of the photos that I want with my nice dSLR camera. Otherwise, a cell phone does the trick.

All this being said, if you are smart and make good choices (like not drinking too much alcohol, going out at night, or putting up a fight), you should be fine even if something scary happens. Morocco's urban areas have a great deal of impoverished people, which brings all of the same challenges as it does everywhere. But the economy is propped up by tourism and the government has an extraordinary commitment to ensuring the safety of foreigners. You can always ask a cop for help. If necessary, call me or someone from the Arabic Language Center to translate for you on the phone if you are talking to an officer or otherwise need a hand.

### Hygiene

A few quick notes on useful stuff that you'll want to know ahead of time.

First: toilet paper is rare in Morocco. Very rare. Like, shockingly rare. Carry a pack of tissues with you **at all times**. You can buy them everywhere for two or three dirhams. People call them "Tempo" after a common brand (think "Kleenex").

Second: if you do not have a shower in your homestay, you may be using buckets. It's perfectly fine and, frankly, they work pretty well without using much water. The downside is that you lose the "standing in a hot shower when it's cold out" feeling. When you really need to warm up, a trip to the hammam (public bath) is the way to go, but that's another conversation for another day.

Third: Don't drink tap water. Brushing your teeth and whatnot is usually fine, but if you are sensitive to such things, don't feel bad about using bottled water for that, too. A big liter and a half bottle is usually 8-10 dirhams (about a dollar) and they are available all over the place. It's worth carrying one with you. You can also get a big jug to keep in the house to refill your smaller bottle. Water is called "ma." A large bottle is "ma' kabir" and a small one is "ma' saghir."

Third (part 2): When you go to a restaurant, make sure you see someone open the cap on a bottle of water or, better yet, open it yourself. It's not uncommon at cheaper places for people to just refill the bottle from the tap.

## Odds and ends

### Instruments and lessons

Since this is a music class, I know a number of musicians are coming on the trip. By no means is musical training required, but you will have the option of taking private lessons (paid) on various Moroccan instruments like the oud, violin, hand drums, or different wind instruments. If you are interested in lessons and/or in purchasing an instrument, try and let me know ahead of time. The instruments that you find in shops are often of a low quality and real builders need time to create the instruments, especially for things like ours.

### Other questions

We will be meeting a few times before we leave and I am happy to add information from questions that arise in those meetings to this page as we go. If  you have any questions in the meantime, email me at [cwituls@bgsu.edu](mailto:cwituls@bgsu.edu). See you soon!
